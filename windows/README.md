# Win.apk: the Windows x64 port

Win.apk is an unofficial port of [Mac.apk](https://github.com/kksimp/Mac.apk) to
Windows on Intel/AMD (x64). It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Mac.apk
project or Voltare. Win.apk's code lives in `windows/`; `runtime/` (the Android
framework in Java and the shared native sources) comes from upstream and is kept
close to it so that upstream fixes can still be merged. The macOS-only parts of
upstream (the Swift launcher, the Mac build scripts, the prebuilt Mac libraries
and the Mac documentation) are not in this repository.

## Why x64 is a different problem from the Mac

Mac.apk runs an app's native code as is, because Apple Silicon and Android phones
are both arm64. An Intel/AMD CPU cannot execute arm64 code, so on x64 Android apps
fall into three groups:

| Apps | Plan |
|---|---|
| Java/Kotlin only (no `.so`) | Run on HotSpot like on the Mac. Needs only the host layer (window, input, ANGLE on D3D11, audio). |
| Ship `lib/x86_64/*.so` | Load the x86_64 libraries natively with the loader in this directory. Full speed. |
| ARM-only native code | `lib/arm64-v8a` is translated to x86-64 at install time (`winapk-aot`, see `include/winapk/arm64_aot.h`): integer code runs at about native speed, floating point and NEON at about 1.3x, calls into the host at about 2x. What the translation cannot follow runs through the arm64 JIT (dynarmic, 0BSD), about 2.6-6x; the interpreter (about 80x) checks both. 32-bit `armeabi-v7a` is not supported. |

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `include/winapk/elf64_defs.h` | ELF64 / x86-64 psABI layouts (Windows has no `<elf.h>`) |
| `include/winapk/guest_abi.h` | `WINAPK_GUEST_ABI`: the boundary between System V and Microsoft x64 calls |
| `src/elf_loader.cpp` | Android x86_64 ELF loader: segments, RELA/RELR/APS2 relocations, protections, RELRO, init/fini |
| `src/elf_tls.cpp` | Dynamic ELF TLS for guest libraries: module ids, `__tls_get_addr`, a block per thread and module |
| `src/fs_tls_patch.cpp` | Rewrites the Bionic stack guard `%fs:0x28` to `%gs:0x28` (`NT_TIB.ArbitraryUserPointer`) |
| `src/mini_bionic.cpp`, `src/bionic/` | The Windows Bionic shim (sysv_abi functions over the UCRT and Win32): strings, printf, pthread, files, time, `mmap`, system properties and the environment, Android paths, pipes/eventfd/epoll, sockets on Winsock, `ALooper`, and `libz.so` on a statically linked zlib. `test/bionic_test.cpp` (`winapk-bionic-test`) checks it against `test/guest/bionic_guest.c` |
| `tools/elfrun_main.cpp` | `winapk-elfrun`: loads `.so` files and runs the PoC checks |
| `test/guest/poc_guest.c` | The Android x86_64 test library |
| `include/winapk/abi_thunk.h`, `src/abi_thunk.cpp` | Runtime machine-code thunks for the JNI bridge: native-method thunks from Microsoft x64 callers to System V code (built per Java signature) and the System V variadic `va_list` entry stub |
| `tools/gen_jni_slots.py`, `src/jni_slots.inc` | Generated `JNINativeInterface_` slot table (235 slots) the guest `JNIEnv` wrapper is built from |
| `include/winapk/guest_jni.h`, `src/guest_jni.cpp` | The guest `JNIEnv`/`JavaVM` wrapper: per-thread guest env, a generic System V forwarder into HotSpot's table for every non-variadic slot, and `GetEnv`/`Attach`/`Detach`. Needs a JDK's `jni.h` at build time (`-DWINAPK_JNI_INCLUDE=$JAVA_HOME/include`) |
| `include/winapk/jni_variadic.h`, `src/jni_variadic.cpp` | The variadic `Call<T>Method` / `...V` / `NewObject` bridge (31 families, one template keyed on the `...A` slot): reads the argument stream against the method signature and repacks it into the `jvalue[]` of HotSpot's A-form. Needs a `SignatureProvider` (JVMTI-backed in the real host, a map in tests) |
| `include/winapk/linker.h`, `src/linker.cpp` | The guest linker: loads a library with its `DT_NEEDED` tree (bionic's lookup order, system libraries answered by the shim), keeps the registry of loaded images, and implements the guest's `dlopen`, `dlsym`, `dladdr`, `dlerror` and `dlclose`. `test/linker_test.cpp` (`winapk-linker-test`) checks it against `test/guest/link_guest.c` |
| `include/winapk/jni_bind.h`, `src/jni_bind.cpp` | Binding guest natives into HotSpot: the guest `RegisterNatives` slot wraps each function in a thunk, and a JVMTI `NativeMethodBind` hook does the same for natives bound by name. Also the cached JVMTI signature provider |
| `include/winapk/arm64_cpu.h`, `src/arm64/` | The arm64 track (M10): an AArch64 interpreter (`arm64_cpu.cpp` for integer, memory and branches, `arm64_simd.cpp` for FP and NEON) and its bridge to the host (`arm64_guest.cpp`, `include/winapk/arm64_guest.h`): AAPCS64 to System V calls into the shim, `va_list` conversion, host calls into guest code through an execute-fault handler, per-thread guest stacks and TLS. `ElfImage` loads arm64 libraries with it. `test/arm64_test.cpp` (`winapk-arm64-test`) checks the interpreter against the same C code built for the host, and the bridge against `test/guest/arm64_bridge_guest.c` |
| `host/` | `winapk-runtime.exe`, the host that runs an APK: DEX conversion, the in-process JVM, the host natives (window and input, `NativeOs`, `NativeLooper`, `NativeImageCodec` with libwebp and WIC, `NativeAudio` on WASAPI; the rest are still stubs), app native libraries (`guest_libs.cpp`), and `Boot.run`. `test/audio_test.cpp` (`winapk-audio-test`) checks the audio backend |
| `scripts/` | `build_java.sh` (upstream's Java runtime with a stock JDK), `build_framework_res.sh` (the platform resource APK) and `stage_runtime.sh` (a runnable `bin/` + `lib/` folder) |
| `tools/jvmrun_main.cpp` | `winapk-jvm-run`: the real-JVM end-to-end test. Creates a HotSpot JVM, loads an Android x86_64 `.so` through the guest linker, runs its `JNI_OnLoad` (which registers a native itself), binds a second native through the `NativeMethodBind` hook, and calls both from Java; one of them calls back into Java through the guest `JNIEnv`. `test/guest/jni_guest.c` and `test/java/WinApkJniTest.java` are its inputs; `test/build_e2e.sh` builds them and `test/run_e2e_wine.sh` runs it under Wine |

What the PoC checks: int/double/stack arguments across the ABI boundary, RELATIVE,
`R_X86_64_64`, GLOB_DAT/JUMP_SLOT, RELR and Android APS2 relocations, `DT_INIT_ARRAY`,
calls from guest code into the shim, host callbacks into guest code, and stack-protected guest code
on the main thread and on new threads.

## Build and run

On Windows ([MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), CLANG64 shell):

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-{clang,cmake,ninja,zlib}
cmake -S windows -B build -G Ninja && cmake --build build
./build/winapk-elfrun.exe path/to/libwinapk_poc_guest.so
```

The guest libraries are built with plain clang + lld, so no NDK is needed:
`windows/test/build_guest.sh`.

On Linux (cross-compile, run under Wine): `windows/test/run_poc_wine.sh`.

The JNI library and its tests (`winapk-jni-test`, `winapk-jni-variadic-test`,
`winapk-jvm-run`) build only when CMake is given a JDK's include directory:
`-DWINAPK_JNI_INCLUDE=$JAVA_HOME/include`.
The real-JVM test runs under Wine with `windows/test/run_e2e_wine.sh`; see
`PORTING.md`, section 9, for the full local setup.

CI: `.github/workflows/windows-poc.yml` builds the guests on Ubuntu and runs all
tests on a real `windows-latest` runner.

Toolchain: clang only. MSVC cannot emit System V calls, and mingw GCC 13 emits
broken SEH unwind data for `sysv_abi` functions.

## Trying it

Download `Win.apk-Setup.exe` (or `Win.apk-windows-x64.zip`) from the
repository's Releases page. The installer puts Win.apk in the Start menu for
the current user and opens `.apk` files with it. `Win.apk.exe` is the app
library (`launcher/launcher_main.cpp`, the counterpart of upstream's
`launcher/`):

- **Adding an app:** drop an APK on it to install the app. The APK is copied into
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Win.apk\library`, installed and converted once by
  `winapk-runtime --install-only` (which also renders the app's icon and
  resolves its name), and given Start menu and desktop shortcuts with its own
  icon.
- **Running and managing:** double-click an app to run it; right-click for Get
  Info, shortcuts, its files and log, updating it from a newer APK,
  reinstalling or removing it. Typing searches the library.
- **Hebrew:** the library is in Hebrew, laid out right to left, when Windows
  is; the settings can pick English or Hebrew instead.
- **Settings** (the gear): language, light or dark theme, the default app for `.apk`
  files, the phone's screen size and orientation, desktop shortcuts, and the
  logs and app data folders.

The package holds the runtime, a Java runtime, ANGLE and `README.txt`, which
says what works, where app data and logs are, and what to attach to a bug
report. Every CI run on
`windows-latest` also uploads the same folder as the `winapk-preview`
artifact.

A release is made by running the "Windows release" workflow
(`.github/workflows/windows-release.yml`) by hand with a tag such as
`v0.1.0-preview`: it builds on Windows, packages `windows/package/` with the
staged runtime, boots an APK from the package as a smoke test, builds the
installer with Inno Setup, and publishes both as a GitHub pre-release with
`windows/package/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## Running an APK

```sh
windows/scripts/stage_runtime.sh build runtime     # after building with CMake
runtime/bin/winapk-runtime.exe --apk app.apk --jdk "$JAVA_HOME"
```

`--apk` also takes a split bundle (`.apkm`, `.xapk` or `.apks`), installed once
as `base.apk` plus `split_*.apk` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Win.apk\app`. The app
opens in its own window, with its own icon, and takes mouse, wheel and keyboard input
(Escape is Android's Back). Java-only apps work this way, including OpenGL
from Java (`GLSurfaceView`, libGDX) on ANGLE, and so do apps that draw with
OpenGL ES from their own native code through a SurfaceView (SDL games);
`NativeActivity` apps and native audio (OpenSL ES, AAudio) are not there yet. App data goes to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Win.apk`.

The runtime and the app data may live in folders with names in any language,
whatever "Language for non-Unicode programs" is set to: the runtime's manifest
makes its ANSI code page UTF-8 (Windows 10 1903 and later), which is how the
JVM gets such paths whole, and the steps that run in a separate JVM (install,
DEX conversion) run in a child of `winapk-runtime.exe` rather than `java.exe`.
Older Windows ignores the manifest; there the runtime passes the JVM 8.3 short
names, which covers the app data, but the runtime's own folder needs plain
letters (the JDK loads its DLLs by their long names).

The app sees a 360x800 dp phone, the most common phone screen.
`WINAPK_PHONE_SIZE=412x915` sets another size, in dp. The window shows the
phone at the monitor's scale. When the whole window, title bar included, would
not fit the monitor's work area (the screen without the taskbar), the app gets
a lower density instead, so it keeps its dp size and still draws at the
window's own pixel size. The window is fitted again when it moves to another
monitor or the taskbar changes. `WINAPK_DENSITY` (a dpi) overrides the density.
A window maximized or resized to another shape keeps the app's size and
shows the phone at the largest size with its own aspect, centred, with black
bars around it, as upstream's letterbox container does: a portrait app
maximized on a wide screen is a phone in the middle, scaled to the screen
height. Clicks on the bars go nowhere. `MACAPK_LETTERBOX=0` stretches the
phone over the whole window instead, as before.

An app runs once at a time, as on the Mac: starting it again (a shortcut, the
library) brings the running app's window forward, and updating it while it
runs is refused until it is closed. `WINAPK_ALLOW_SECOND_INSTANCE=1` turns the
check off.

### Web content (WebView2)

Web pages an app shows run in Microsoft Edge WebView2, the counterpart of
upstream's WKWebView. It needs the WebView2 Runtime, which Windows 11 and most
Windows 10 machines already have; `WebView2Loader.dll`, the SDK's
redistributable loader, sits next to `winapk-runtime.exe`
(`windows/scripts/fetch_webview2.sh`). Without the runtime, without the loader,
headless, or with `WINAPK_WEBVIEW2=0`, web links open in the system browser as
before, and the log says so once.

- A Custom Tab or Trusted Web Activity launch (androidx.browser's
  `CustomTabsIntent`, AppAuth's sign-in, a TWA launcher) opens a tab window over
  the app: close, back and the URL on a toolbar, the page title as the window
  title. As in a Custom Tab on a phone, every navigation is checked against the
  app's own manifest: a page that goes to a URL the app handles (an OAuth or
  sign-in callback, as a custom scheme or an `https` App Link) is not loaded but
  delivered to the app as the browser's `ACTION_VIEW` intent, and the tab
  closes. Other pages keep loading in the tab. The browser row the
  PackageManager lists (`com.macapk.host`) answers androidx.browser's Custom
  Tabs service, so apps that look for one choose a Custom Tab.
- A plain link (an "open in browser", a Privacy Policy link) still opens in the
  system browser: on a phone that is the user's browser app too.
- An app's own `android.webkit.WebView`s show the page in the app window, at
  the view's place, behind the app's views drawn over it: upstream's Java
  WebView runs unchanged on WebView2 (`native_webview.cpp`), with
  `WebViewClient`, `WebChromeClient`, `evaluateJavascript`,
  `addJavascriptInterface` (a synchronous call, as on a device),
  `CookieManager`, `loadData` and `loadDataWithBaseURL`.
- Cookies and storage are the app's own, in `app_webview2` in its data
  directory, kept between runs; the browser tab has a profile of its own
  there.

Shared storage is the user's own folders, as on a phone: `/sdcard/Download`,
`Pictures`, `Documents`, `Music` and `Movies` are junctions to Windows'
Downloads, Pictures, Documents, Music and Videos (wherever they are
redirected), made before the app starts; what an app had saved there moves in
first, never over a file of the user's (a clash comes in as
`name (from Android).ext`; every move is logged in
`android\data\system\storage\usermap-journal.tsv`). DCIM stays the
volume's own. Only for the library in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Win.apk`, never with
`--data`. Settings > App data > "Use my Windows folders" (`UserFolders`) off
turns each folder back into an empty one of the volume, files left in place;
`MACAPK_USER_FOLDERS=0` changes nothing either way.

For tests, `WINAPK_TEST_WORKAREA=1366x728` stands in for the work area, in
pixels (`1366x728-0+0` puts it at the top right of the real one;
`@file` reads the value from a file at every fit),
`WINAPK_HEADLESS=1` runs without a window,
`WINAPK_HEADLESS_FRAME=frame.bmp` saves the last frame the app drew, and
`WINAPK_HEADLESS_EXIT_AFTER_FRAMES=30` exits that many display frames after the
first one the app presents (an idle app counts too). On
Linux, `windows/test/run_app_wine.sh` boots an APK headless under Wine.

## Status and next steps

The goal is the whole of Mac.apk on Windows x64: every Mac piece ported or
replaced with its Windows counterpart (PORTING.md section 4 lists them one by
one), then x86_64 apps at full speed, then ARM-only apps through translation
(arm64-v8a is supported: translated ahead of time, with a JIT fallback;
32-bit armeabi-v7a is not).

Done so far:

- The loader, linker, ELF TLS and the JNI bridge for Android x86_64 libraries.
- arm64-v8a libraries, when an app has no x86_64 build (apps install with
  the ABIs `x86_64,arm64-v8a`; `WINAPK_ABIS` overrides): the same loader,
  linker and JNI bridge, checked in CI against the host and in a real JVM.
  In the background (`prepare_arm64` and `winapk-runtime --aot-translate`
  in `host/runtime_main.cpp`; nothing waits for it) `winapk-aot` turns each
  `lib/arm64/*.so` into C, in parts, and clang (`WINAPK_AOT_CLANG`,
  `<install>\clang\bin\clang.exe` or the PATH; the launcher also finds an
  LLVM or MSYS2 clang) compiles the parts in parallel with
  `-O1 -march=native` into `<lib>.so.aot.dll`. A library of more than 400K
  instructions is translated only where the JIT's profile
  (`<lib>.so.aot.profile`) says code ran, and again as that grows; a
  translation finished while the app runs is loaded at once (see
  `include/winapk/arm64_aot.h`, "Profiles"). Functions of more than 4000
  instructions are compiled unoptimized (clang's time on them grows far
  faster than their size), and whole translations are shared between apps
  through `<data>\aot-cache`, keyed by the library's code. Code without a
  translation runs through a JIT (dynarmic) backed by an interpreter. CMake option
  `-DWINAPK_ARM64_JIT=ON` (CI and releases) fetches dynarmic;
  `WINAPK_ARM64_ENGINE=interp` forces the interpreter, and
  `WINAPK_ARM64_STATS=1` prints at exit where the guest's time went (host
  functions versus arm64 code, transitions, interpreter fallbacks).
- The Bionic shim: about 520 libc functions (threads, files, sockets,
  epoll, `ALooper`, printf and scanf), on the UCRT and Win32.
- The host: the window and input, `NativeOs`, `NativeLooper`, images (libwebp,
  WIC), audio (WASAPI: AudioTrack, SoundPool, MediaPlayer's audio, OpenSL ES,
  AAudio, recording; Media Foundation decodes), clipboard, file pickers, game
  controllers, ICU, SQLite, WebView on WebView2, the camera (Media Foundation
  capture), location (`Windows.Devices.Geolocation`), the radios' state,
  photos and wallpapers, the user's own folders as shared storage, and
  Android's permission dialogs (through the launcher's helper).
- OpenGL ES on ANGLE, from Java and from app native code (`ANativeWindow`,
  EGL window surfaces), plus libandroid's assets, and `NativeActivity` with
  the NDK input queue and `AConfiguration` (`host/native_activity.cpp`).
- The app library (`Win.apk.exe`) with shortcuts per app, the Store (F-Droid),
  the installer (`package/winapk.iss`, English and Hebrew) and the release
  workflow.

Next, in order: video (MediaPlayer and the NDK media API on Media
Foundation), Vulkan (`VK_KHR_win32_surface`), sensors, W^X thunks with unwind
tables and a crash handler (M9), code signing, then a wider compatibility
corpus. ARM code (M10) is translated ahead of time, with the JIT
as the fallback; 32-bit `armeabi-v7a` stays unsupported.

`PORTING.md` holds the design decisions, the technical findings, the known
gaps, and the milestone plan up to a production release.

## Keeping up with upstream

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kksimp/Mac.apk.git   # once
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Upstream's macOS-only files were removed here, so a merge that touches them
stops with a modify/delete conflict: keep them deleted (`git rm` the file).
Files in `runtime/` are changed only where a Windows hook is unavoidable, and
every such change is listed here:

- `runtime/java/android/content/res/Resources.java`: `getIntArray` resolves the
  items of a typed `<array>` (for example a list of color references) instead
  of returning an empty array. Not Windows-specific; worth offering upstream.
- `runtime/java/android/view/ViewPropertyAnimator.java`: starts by itself on
  the next frame when the app never calls `start()`, as on Android. Not
  Windows-specific; worth offering upstream.
- `runtime/java/android/widget/RatingBar.java` and `ProgressBar.java`: a rating
  bar reads `numStars`, `rating`, `stepSize` and `isIndicator` from XML and
  measures one row of stars, as AOSP does. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.java`: `BEGIN`,
  `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` given to `execSQL` nest in the transaction stack, as
  AOSP's `SQLiteSession.executeSpecial` does. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/view/LayoutInflater.java`: a `<merge>` layout inflated
  without a parent merges into a `FrameLayout` instead of being dropped, so
  `setContentView` of a `<merge>` layout works. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/ActivityHost.java`: an activity that calls
  `finish()` in its own `onCreate` is torn down after `onCreate` returns, as on
  AOSP, not in the middle of it. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/FragmentInflaterFactory.java`: a fragment in
  a layout is hosted by the activity the inflater belongs to, which also works
  during the first activity's `onCreate`. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/DomXmlResourceParser.java` and
  `BinaryXmlParser.java`: the resource parser's `next()` skips whitespace-only
  text and comments, as the device's parser over aapt-compiled XML never sees
  them (a `while (next() != END_TAG) nextText()` loop over a text-form resource
  threw "nextText not on START_TAG"), and the compiled-XML reader keeps text
  chunks, so an element's content (`<key>` in a media-browser allow list) is no
  longer empty. Not Windows-specific; worth offering upstream.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/dex/InitRepointPlan.java`: the DEX converter also
  synthesises the constructor R8 deleted when the call site still names the
  allocated class (`new-instance T; invoke-direct T.<init>(D)` with no
  `T.<init>(D)` left, often no class data at all), which ART resolves up the
  superclass chain and HotSpot refuses with NoSuchMethodError. NetGuard's
  main activity and androidx.startup failed on it (170 such sites in one
  DEX). Not Windows-specific; worth offering upstream.
- `runtime/java/android/system/Os.java`: `chmod` and `fchmod` (Key Mapper
  died at start on the missing method). Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/preference/Preference.java`: an app subclass that
  overrides `onGetDefaultValue(TypedArray, int)` gets it called, with a
  TypedArray holding `android:defaultValue`; the String the AttributeSet twin
  reads broke DroidFish's ColorPickerPreference with a ClassCastException. Not
  Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/FragmentInflaterFactory.java`: a
  `FragmentContainerView[android:name]` whose app FragmentManager cannot be
  found by name (R8 renamed it) goes through the activity's own
  `onCreateView` override, AOSP's route, instead of the view's 2-arg
  constructor, which throws (Auxio, Tremotesf). Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/provider/MediaStoreProvider.java`: a projection may
  hold an aggregate over a known column (`COUNT(is_music)`, `COUNT(*)`,
  `MAX(date_added)`) or an alias (`_data AS path`), as MediaProvider's
  projection greylist allows; before, the aggregate was answered as a NULL
  column and a COUNT over an empty table had no row. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/security/keystore/AndroidKeyStoreKeyFactorySpi.java`:
  delegates to the other providers only, instead of recursing into itself
  until the stack overflows. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/os/Build.java`, `dalvik/system/VMRuntime.java`,
  `com/macapk/loader/Boot.java` (`os.arch`), `InstalledSplits.java` and
  `MacApkPackageManager.java`: the device ABI is the host's, so x86_64 on
  Windows x64, and the native library directory includes `lib/x86_64`. On the
  Mac nothing changes. `Boot.java` also looks for `bin/macapk-translator.exe`.
  On an x86_64 host `Build.SUPPORTED_ABIS` also lists arm64-v8a, which is
  translated to x86-64 (ahead of time, with a JIT fallback), as an x86_64
  Android device with an ARM translator reports it.
- `runtime/java/android/content/Context.java`: `getDatabasePath` also takes a
  drive-letter path as absolute, so a database named by its full path is not
  nested inside `databases\`.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/CameraBridge.java`: when the capture natives
  are unbound or report no device (no webcam, or camera access is off in
  Windows privacy settings; the webcams themselves come from
  `windows/host/native_camera.cpp`), one virtual back camera delivers
  dark-grey frames, so screens built around a preview open and their other
  controls work. `MACAPK_VIRTUAL_CAMERA=0` turns it off. A real camera always
  wins.
- `runtime/java/android/view/SurfaceView.java`: a SurfaceView laid out larger
  than its window (a center-cropped camera preview) whose holder has no GL
  consumer yet (no renderer, not a `GLSurfaceView`, not the native-window
  owner) reports the view's size and gets `surfaceChanged` for it, as AOSP
  always does. Apps that start their camera preview only after that
  `surfaceChanged` waited forever. `MACAPK_SV_OVERSIZE_HOLDER=0` turns it off.
  Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/webkit/MacApkWebViewBridge.java` and `WebView.java`:
  `macapkWantsIntercept` / `macapkInterceptRequest`, through which an engine
  that can hold a request open (`windows/host/native_webview.cpp`, WebView2's
  deferral) offers it to `WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest` and serves the
  app's response. Cordova and Capacitor apps (`WebViewAssetLoader`,
  `https://localhost/`) failed with `net::ERR_FAILED` without it. The Mac's
  engine does not call them.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/LocationBridge.java`, `SpecialAccessHandler.java`,
  `ActivityHost.java` and `MacApkPackageManager.java`: the host may name its
  location settings page (`nativeHostSettingsUrl`; Windows:
  `ms-settings:privacy-location`, from `windows/host/native_location.cpp`).
  `Settings.ACTION_LOCATION_SOURCE_SETTINGS` opens it, and so does a location
  request the host itself refuses (location off for apps in Windows), once per
  run. `android.hardware.location` and `.network` are declared when the
  location is bridged. On the Mac, which binds no such native, nothing changes
  but the two features.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/HostRadios.java` (new), with
  `android/net/wifi/WifiManager.java`, `WifiInfo.java`,
  `android/bluetooth/BluetoothAdapter.java`, `BluetoothDevice.java` and
  `MacApkPackageManager.java`: the host's Wi-Fi (state, connection, scan
  results, `SCAN_RESULTS_AVAILABLE_ACTION`) and Bluetooth radio (on/off, name,
  paired devices; no connections) reach the app, from
  `windows/host/native_radios.cpp`; `android.hardware.bluetooth` is declared
  when there is a radio. A host without these natives (the Mac) keeps the old
  answers.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/ActivityHost.java` and
  `MacApkPackageManager.java`: a Custom Tab launch opens in
  `HostBrowserTab` (new, with `HostCustomTabsService`) when the host has a
  browser tab of its own, and the host browser row then answers the Custom Tabs
  service; its PackageInfo carries `signingInfo`. On the Mac, which has no such
  tab, nothing changes but the `signingInfo`.
- `runtime/java/android/webkit/WebView.java`: with a modal window above a
  WebView, the occluder rects sent to the engine add that window's bounds
  after the whole-view rect, so an engine that shows the page over the canvas
  (Windows) can keep the dialog visible. The union, which the Mac's hit test
  uses, is unchanged.
- `runtime/java/android/widget/TextView.java`: the protected `onTextChanged`
  hook is called on every text change (constructor, `setText`, typing,
  `append`, in-place edits), with or without `TextWatcher`s, as AOSP does. It
  was declared but never called, so custom fields that keep their state there
  (an SMS-code `PinView`) drew nothing and ignored typing. Also
  `setText(text, BufferType.SPANNABLE)` stores a `Spannable`, and the type
  sticks for later `setText` calls, so `(Spannable) getText()` works. Not
  Windows-specific; worth offering upstream.
- `runtime/java/android/view/Window.java`: the eight activity-transition
  getters and setters keep their values and default to the theme's
  transitions (`windowActivityTransitions`), as AOSP `PhoneWindow` does,
  instead of always returning null; apps that add a listener to
  `getSharedElementEnterTransition()` no longer crash in `onCreate`. Not
  Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/content/res/TypedArray.java` and `Resources.java`:
  `getDimensionPixelSize` (and a drawable's `<stroke android:width>` /
  `<size>`) round and keep a non-zero size at least 1 px, as AOSP does, so
  0.5dp hairlines and borders are drawn; `getDimensionPixelOffset` still
  truncates. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/SharedStorage.java`,
  `android/provider/MediaStoreProvider.java`,
  `android/app/usage/StorageStatsManager.java` and
  `com/macapk/loader/HostDocumentsProvider.java`: the volume's Download,
  Pictures, Documents, Music and Movies are junctions to the user's Windows
  folders, made by the host (`windows/host/user_folders.cpp`, named in
  `WINAPK_USER_FOLDER_TARGETS`). Java sees a junction as a plain directory, so
  these recognise it (`isJunction`, `isHostFolderMapping`, `isLink`): MediaStore
  keeps upstream's privacy filter and walk cache for them and indexes at most
  10,000 files per folder, breadth first (`walkHostFolder`); no walk, size or
  delete follows a junction inside a folder; and `mapUserFolders` stays off when
  the host maps, since it would merge a junction into itself. On the Mac nothing
  changes.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/Manifest.java`: the components of installed
  feature splits (`isFeatureSplit="true"`) are merged into the package, as
  AOSP `parseSplitApplication` does. Chrome keeps its launcher alias and
  `ChromeTabbedActivity` in `split_chrome.apk`, and was rejected with "no
  launchable activity". `MACAPK_MANIFEST_FEATURE_SPLITS=0` reads the base alone.
  Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/app/HandoffActivityData.java`,
  `HandoffActivityDataRequestInfo.java` (new, API 37 type-only placeholders)
  and `com/macapk/loader/ActivityHost.java`: an activity overriding a newer-API
  callback no longer fails every lifecycle call with `NoClassDefFoundError`;
  a class whose methods cannot be resolved is skipped in favour of the
  superclass declaration, which still dispatches to the override
  (`MACAPK_LIFECYCLE_SKIP_UNLINKABLE=0` turns that off). Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/app/Application.java` (`AppBaseContext`): has the
  `mClassLoader` field of AOSP `ContextImpl`, and `getClassLoader` returns it
  when set; Chromium sets it reflectively for isolated splits
  (`MACAPK_CONTEXT_MCLASSLOADER=0` ignores it). Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/android/app/Application.java`, `Activity.java` and
  `com/macapk/loader/ActivityHost.java`: `onActivityPreCreated` goes out before
  `onCreate`, `onActivityCreated` from `Activity.onCreate` (or after it when
  the override skips super), and `onActivityPostCreated` before a `finish()` in
  `onCreate` tears the activity down, as AOSP does. Chromium's
  `ApplicationStatus` depends on it. `MACAPK_LIFECYCLE_CREATED_ORDER=0` restores
  the old order. Not Windows-specific.
- `runtime/java/com/macapk/loader/SpecialAccessStore.java`: on Windows the
  app-ops store (`appops\app-ops.json`, `signing-key.pub`) and the registry
  (`installed_apps.json`) are read from the data folder, the parent of the
  android root, and an app's identity is the registry's one row for the
  running package (every app shares the android root here). The launcher is
  the helper that writes the store (`Win.apk.exe runtime-permission`,
  `special-access`, `app-details`, in `launcher/launcher_main.cpp`), with
  upstream's payload and tokens. On the Mac nothing changes.
