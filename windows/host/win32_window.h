// win32_window.h -- the one top-level window an app runs in.
//
// Upstream draws into an NSWindow per app; this is its Win32 counterpart, kept
// apart from the JNI code in native_cocoa.cpp. The window has its own UI thread
// with a message loop, so nothing here depends on which Java thread calls in.
//
// Frames arrive as ARGB pixels at the app's surface size, which is the pixel
// size of the box the window shows the app in (the whole client area, or a
// letterbox inside it), so a frame at the right size is copied pixel for
// pixel; GDI scales only when the app is meant to draw at another size (a
// monitor with another scale, WINAPK_RESIZABLE=0). Input goes back out through
// WindowInput, already translated to Android's MotionEvent and KeyEvent terms:
//
//   the mouse's left button   one finger on the touchscreen (pointer)
//   a touchscreen, a pen      every contact a pointer of its own (touch)
//   the wheel                 a scroll step, or a short drag for an app whose
//                             views take no scroll step (wheel)
//   Ctrl+wheel, and a pinch   two fingers moving apart or together around the
//   on a precision touchpad   cursor (pinch)
//   the other buttons, and    a mouse: the right button opens what a long
//   the pointer over the app  press opens, the pointer hovers (mouse)
//   the keyboard              key events with the character Windows says the
//                             key types (key); composed text (text); an input
//                             method's composition (composing)
//
// Positions are pixels in the box the app draws in (window_app_box), origin at
// its top left, with the box's size beside them.
