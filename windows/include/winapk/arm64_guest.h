// arm64_guest.h -- running Android arm64-v8a code inside the Windows x64 host
// (milestone M10, stage 1). The CPU itself is in arm64_cpu.h; this is the
// bridge around it.
//
// Where guest code enters the system (PORTING.md, D8) nothing changes for the
// rest of the runtime: ElfImage loads an arm64 library like an x86_64 one,
// GuestLinker links it, and every call between the two worlds keeps the System
// V convention the x86_64 path already uses. The bridge converts at the edge:
//
//   * guest -> host: an arm64 library's imports are bound to the same System V
//     host functions an x86_64 library gets (the Bionic shim, libdl, GL, ...).
//     When the interpreter branches to an address that is not arm64 code, it
//     calls that address as a System V function: x0-x5 go to rdi..r9, x6, x7
//     and the guest's stack arguments to the host stack, v0-v7 to xmm0-xmm7
//     (with al = 8 for variadic callees); rax/rdx/xmm0 come back as x0/x1/v0.
//     That covers every function whose arguments are scalars or pointers,
//     variadic ones included. The one argument type the two conventions lay
//     out differently is va_list: functions that take one (vsnprintf, the JNI
//     ...V forms) are registered with register_va_list_function and get the
//     guest's AAPCS64 va_list rewritten as a System V one.
//
//   * host -> guest: arm64 code is mapped without execute permission, so a
//     host call into it (a callback the guest registered: qsort comparators,
//     pthread_create start routines, JNI natives, JNI_OnLoad, atexit
//     handlers, ...) raises an execute fault. A vectored exception handler
//     turns that fault into a call through the interpreter, with the System V
//     arguments moved into AAPCS64 registers. No callback needs to be known in
//     advance. host_callable() gives the same entry without the fault, for hot
//     paths such as native-method thunks.
//
// Each host thread that runs guest code gets its own CPU state, a 4 MiB guest
// stack and bionic's TLS slot array (TPIDR_EL0, with the stack guard in slot 5),
// created on first use and freed when the thread exits. Guest -> host -> guest
// nesting (a qsort comparator inside qsort inside guest code) continues on the
// same guest stack.
//
// setjmp and longjmp are the exception to "every import is a host function":
// they save and restore guest registers, so the bridge implements them itself
// (guest_intrinsic).
//
// Not supported yet: arguments or results passed by value as structs larger
// than 16 bytes or as floating-point aggregates (the conventions disagree;
// libc and JNI have none), raw system calls (SVC), and ELF TLS through TLSDESC
// (apps built for API 29+ that use thread_local; emulated TLS works).
