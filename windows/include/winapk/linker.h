// linker.h -- the guest dynamic linker: loads Android x86_64 or arm64
// libraries together with their DT_NEEDED dependencies, keeps a registry of
// what is loaded, and implements the guest's libdl (dlopen, dlsym, dladdr, ...).
// A dependency must have the same ABI as the library that needs it, as on
// Android.
//
// ElfImage (elf_loader.h) loads one library. GuestLinker does what bionic's
// linker does around that:
//
//   * load: maps the whole DT_NEEDED tree breadth-first, links every new
//     library, then runs constructors dependencies first. JNI_OnLoad is never
//     called here; on Android the dynamic linker does not call it either
//     (System.loadLibrary does, for the library it was asked for only).
//   * system libraries: a DT_NEEDED or dlopen name from the NDK's public set
//     (libc.so, liblog.so, libGLESv2.so, ...) is not a file. It is answered by
//     the host shim through LinkerConfig::host.
//   * symbol lookup when linking a new library, in bionic's order: the global
//     group first (the host shim, standing in for app_process and its libc,
//     then libraries opened with RTLD_GLOBAL), then the local group (the
//     dlopen'ed root and its dependency tree, breadth-first). A library's own
//     definitions are bound directly (ElfImage does not support interposition
//     of a symbol the library defines itself).
//   * dlsym(handle) walks the handle's dependency tree breadth-first, so a
//     dependency's Java_* symbols are found through the library that needs it.
//     The addresses it returns are raw System V addresses: a guest that calls
//     another library's JNI_OnLoad itself (Unity's libmain does) gets the real
//     function.
//   * dlclose: each dlopen (and each open() by the host, for a library
//     System.load gave the JVM) is a reference; a C++ thread_local destructor
//     registered from a library is one too until it has run. When the last
//     reference goes, the library is unloaded unless it was opened with
//     RTLD_NODELETE: DT_FINI_ARRAY and DT_FINI run (last initialized first),
//     its __cxa_atexit entries, the unload hooks (the JNI thunk cache, the
//     host's tables), its TLS blocks are freed on every thread, and the
//     dependencies nothing else needs go the same way, as bionic's
//     soinfo_unload does. A later dlopen maps and initializes it afresh.
//     Thunks already built for its functions stay in the thunk pool (a bump
//     allocator; a few dozen bytes each), unreferenced.
//
// Not done yet:
//   * linker namespaces and android_dlopen_ext's extinfo (loading from an fd
//     or from inside the APK) are ignored.
