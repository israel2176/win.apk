// elf_tls.h -- dynamic ELF TLS for guest libraries.
//
// Android libraries built for API 29 and later may use ELF TLS (`thread_local`,
// `__thread`) instead of emulated TLS. A shared library reaches its TLS through
// the general-dynamic model: the compiler emits `__tls_get_addr(&index)`, where
// `index` is a GOT pair the loader fills from R_X86_64_DTPMOD64 (the module id)
// and R_X86_64_DTPOFF64 (the offset inside the module's TLS block).
//
// Each library with a PT_TLS segment registers here and gets a module id. A
// thread's block for a module is allocated on its first access, from the
// module's initialization image (.tdata, then zeroed .tbss), and freed when
// the thread exits (an FLS callback, so it also covers threads the guest did
// not create through pthread_create) or when the module is unregistered
// (dlclose): every thread's block for it is freed then, so a module id can be
// handed out again once its library is gone.
//
// C++ thread_local destructors (Bionic's __cxa_thread_atexit_impl) are kept
// here too, next to the blocks their objects live in: a thread runs them,
// newest first, before its blocks are freed. Each registration tells the
// linker (tls_set_dso_hooks) which library it belongs to, so that library is
// not unmapped while a thread still has one of its destructors to run.
//
// Not supported: the static (initial-exec and local-exec) models, which read
// %fs:0 directly and need R_X86_64_TPOFF64. Bionic only allows those in the
// executable and libc itself, so app libraries do not use them.
