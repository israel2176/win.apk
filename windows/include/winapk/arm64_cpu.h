// arm64_cpu.h -- an AArch64 (A64) user-mode CPU for running Android arm64-v8a
// code on an x64 host. Milestone M10, stage 1 (see PORTING.md).
//
// This is an interpreter: it decodes and executes one instruction at a time.
// It is the correctness baseline the ARM track is built on, not the final
// engine: a JIT (dynarmic, 0BSD) can replace run() later without changing the
// state layout below or anything in arm64_guest.h.
//
// Guest and host share one address space. Android arm64 and Windows x64 are
// both LP64 and little-endian, so a guest pointer is a host pointer and guest
// loads and stores are plain host memory accesses. That is what makes it
// possible to pass pointers between guest code and the Bionic shim unchanged.
//
// What is implemented (and checked by test/arm64_test.cpp against the same C
// code compiled for the host):
//   * the whole A64 base integer ISA: arithmetic, logic, bitfields, shifts,
//     multiply/divide, conditional select/compare, CRC32;
//   * branches, including the PAC/BTI hint forms (executed as plain branches
//     and NOPs: there is nothing to authenticate against);
//   * every load/store addressing mode, pairs, literals, exclusives
//     (LDXR/STXR as compare-and-swap), acquire/release and the LSE atomics;
//   * scalar floating point (single, double, conversions to and from integers
//     and half precision);
//   * the Advanced SIMD (NEON) forms compilers emit for ordinary C/C++:
//     vector integer and float arithmetic, compares, shifts, widen/narrow,
//     permutes, table lookups, reductions, loads/stores of 1-4 structures.
//
// An instruction outside that set stops the guest with its encoding and
// address (Hooks::fault), so the next one to add is always named.
