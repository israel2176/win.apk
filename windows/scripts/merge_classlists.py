"""Merges HotSpot class lists into windows/java/winapk-framework.classlist.

    merge_classlists.py [--min-apps N] <out> <list>...

The lists come from app starts with WINAPK_CDS_RECORD_DIR=<dir> (host/cds.h):
one <app>.classlist per app, every class its JVM loaded. The merge is what the
runtime's own merge does (host/cds_util.cpp, merge_classlists): comments and
the per-file " id: <n>" dropped, classes of the app's own loader (lines with
super:/source:) left out, each line once, in the order first seen.

--min-apps N keeps only the lines at least N of the lists have (default 3).
An archived class no app loads still costs every app that maps the archive:
HotSpot relocates the whole archive at each start, so its pages become the
process's own (about 1 MB of private memory per MB of archive, measured in
docs/research/startup-cds.md). Classes that three of the ten smoke apps load
cover 98.6% of the median app's; the first start on a machine adds its own
app's classes anyway.
